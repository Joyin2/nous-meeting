                        <p>
                            The Electronic Communications Privacy Act or Federal Wiretap Act makes it a federal crime to intercept or record wire, oral, or electronic communications without the consent of at least one party. You must ensure compliance with this federal law at a minimum, but stricter state or international laws may also apply.
                        </p>

                            If you or ANY participant is in one of these states, you MUST obtain explicit consent from ALL participants before recording. Failure to comply is a criminal offense that can result in imprisonment, substantial fines, and civil liability. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE for determining applicable state laws and ensuring compliance.
                        </p>

                        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3. International Laws</h4>

                            If any participant is located outside the United States, you must research and comply with all applicable international laws, including but not limited to GDPR (EU/EEA), UK GDPR, PIPEDA (Canada), and other national data protection laws. These laws often impose stricter requirements than U.S. law. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE for determining and complying with all international legal requirements.
