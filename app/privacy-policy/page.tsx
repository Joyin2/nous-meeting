                        <p className="font-semibold mt-3">Host Responsibility:</p>
                        <p>You must ensure at minimum that at least one party to the conversation (which may be you as the host) consents to any recording. However, stricter state laws may apply and require all-party consent. You are responsible for determining and complying with the most restrictive applicable law.</p>

                            Recording laws vary significantly by U.S. state. Some states require consent from all parties ("all-party consent" states), while others require consent from only one party ("one-party consent" states). As the host, you are solely responsible for determining which laws apply and ensuring compliance.
