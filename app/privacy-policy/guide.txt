6. Recording of Meetings - User Responsibility and Legal Compliance
CRITICAL NOTICE: HOST RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECORDING COMPLIANCE
NOUS MEETING IS A TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER ONLY. WE PROVIDE RECORDING TOOLS BUT
DO NOT AND CANNOT ENSURE YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH RECORDING LAWS. YOU, AS THE
MEETING HOST OR RECORDING USER, ARE SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR:
a. Determining which recording laws apply to your meetings
b. Obtaining all required consents from meeting participants
c. Providing proper notice of recording to all participants
d. Complying with ALL applicable federal, state, local, and international laws
e. All legal consequences of violating recording laws
Nous Meeting provides functionality that allows hosts and authorized participants to record
meetings for transcription, summarization, and analysis purposes. By providing this
functionality, Nous Meeting acts solely as a technology service provider and assumes
absolutely no responsibility for how users employ these recording features or whether such
use complies with applicable laws.
6.1 Nous Meeting's Role as Technology Provider
Nous Meeting's Role: Nous Meeting provides software and technology that enables users to
record meetings. We are a technology service provider, not a legal advisor, and we do not
provide legal advice regarding recording compliance.
What We Do NOT Do: Nous Meeting does NOT:
a. Monitor whether you obtain required consents from meeting participants
b. Determine which recording laws apply to your specific meetings
c. Verify that you are complying with applicable recording laws
d. Provide legal advice or guidance on recording compliance
e. Ensure that meeting participants have consented to recording

4

f. Bear any responsibility for your violations of recording laws
Your Acknowledgment: By using Nous Meeting's recording features, you acknowledge and
agree that you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws. Nous
Meeting makes no representations or warranties regarding the legality of recording in any
jurisdiction or circumstance.
6.2 Host's Exclusive Responsibility for Legal Compliance
As the meeting host or user initiating a recording, you bear complete and exclusive legal
responsibility for:
a. Researching and understanding all applicable recording laws in the jurisdictions
where you and your participants are located
b. Determining whether you are in a one-party consent or two-party/all-party
consent jurisdiction
c. Identifying the locations of all meeting participants and determining which
jurisdiction's laws apply
d. Providing clear, conspicuous, and legally adequate notice to all participants
that recording will occur
e. Obtaining all necessary consents as required by applicable federal, state, local,
and international laws
f. Documenting and maintaining records of all consents obtained
g. Providing participants with the opportunity to decline participation or leave the
meeting if they do not consent
h. Complying with data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, etc.) regarding
recorded content
i. Securing recorded content against unauthorized access or disclosure
j. Managing requests from participants regarding access to, correction of, or
deletion of recordings
k. Implementing appropriate data retention and deletion practices
l. Accepting all legal, financial, and criminal consequences of any violations of
recording laws

6.3 Recording Notice and Consent Requirements
Automated Notice Provided by Nous Meeting: Nous Meeting provides automated visual
and/or audio indicators when recording is initiated. These indicators are provided as a
courtesy and technical feature only. However, you acknowledge and agree that:
a. Automated indicators do NOT constitute legally sufficient notice in all
jurisdictions
b. You remain solely responsible for providing legally adequate notice regardless
of automated indicators
c. You must supplement automated indicators with additional notice and consent
mechanisms as required by law

5

Your Obligations Regarding Notice and Consent:
a. Provide advance notice to participants (via email, calendar invite, or other
means) that meetings may be recorded
b. Provide verbal notice at the beginning of each meeting that recording will occur
c. In all-party consent jurisdictions, obtain explicit verbal or written consent from
EVERY participant before recording
d. Allow participants who do not consent to leave the meeting before recording
begins
e. Immediately stop recording if any participant in an all-party consent jurisdiction
withdraws consent
6.4 U.S. Federal Law Requirements
Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act or "Federal Wiretap Act", it is a federal
crime to intercept or record any wire, oral, or electronic communication without the consent
of at least one party to the conversation.
Host Responsibility: You must ensure at minimum that at least one party to the conversation
(which may be you as the host) consents to any recording. However, stricter state laws may
apply and require all-party consent. You are responsible for determining and complying with
the most restrictive applicable law.
6.5 U.S. State Recording Laws - Host's Responsibility to Comply
Recording laws vary significantly by U.S. state. Some states require consent from all parties
("all-party consent" states), while others require consent from only one party ("one-party
consent" states). As the host, you are solely responsible for determining which laws apply and
ensuring compliance.
6.5.1 All-Party Consent States
The following states require consent from ALL parties before recording:
California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana,

Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: If you OR ANY participant is located in one of these states, you
MUST obtain explicit consent from ALL participants before recording. Failure to do so is a
criminal offense.
Your Mandatory Obligations in All-Party Consent Jurisdictions:
a. Obtain explicit verbal or written consent from EVERY participant before
initiating recording
b. Provide clear advance notice that recording will occur
c. Document all consents obtained (via email, recorded audio acknowledgment, or
written consent forms)
d. Allow non-consenting participants to leave before recording starts

6

e. Stop recording immediately if any participant withdraws consent
6.5.2 One-Party Consent States
States not listed in Section 6.5.1 generally follow a one-party consent standard, meaning only
one party to the conversation must consent to recording.
Host Responsibility: Even in one-party consent states, you remain responsible for determining
applicable laws, as participants may be calling from all-party consent jurisdictions.
Additionally, providing notice to all participants is strongly recommended as best practice and
to avoid civil liability, workplace disputes, or professional sanctions.
6.5.3 Determining Applicable Law - Host's Responsibility
Multi-Jurisdictional Meetings: When participants are in different states or countries, the most
restrictive law generally applies. This means:
a. If ANY participant is in an all-party consent state, you must obtain consent from
ALL participants
b. You must research the location of each participant and determine applicable
laws
c. If participants' locations are unknown, you should assume all-party consent is
required

YOU, NOT NOUS MEETING, ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THESE LEGAL
DETERMINATIONS.
6.5.4 Criminal and Civil Consequences of Violations
WARNING: Violating federal or state recording laws can result in severe consequences for
which you bear sole responsibility:
a. Criminal prosecution, fines, and imprisonment
b. Civil lawsuits for statutory and actual damages (some states provide for treble
damages)
c. Attorney's fees and court costs awarded to prevailing plaintiffs
d. Exclusion of illegally obtained recordings as evidence in legal proceedings
e. Professional discipline, employment termination, or other workplace
consequences
f. Reputational damage and loss of trust
g. Additional penalties under specific industry regulations (HIPAA, FERPA, etc.)
6.6 International Recording Laws - Host's Responsibility
When recording meetings with international participants, you must comply with all applicable
international laws, which often impose stricter requirements than U.S. law. As the host, you
are solely responsible for:
a. Identifying the countries from which participants are joining

7
b. Researching applicable data protection and recording laws in those countries
c. Ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to:
European Union/EEA: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires a lawful basis for
processing, explicit consent for certain processing, data protection impact assessments, and
compliance with stringent data subject rights
United Kingdom: UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 impose similar requirements to EU
GDPR
Canada: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and
provincial privacy laws require meaningful consent and impose strict data handling
requirements
Australia: Privacy Act 1988 and Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979
Other Jurisdictions: Numerous countries have enacted comprehensive data protection laws
with varying requirements
NOUS MEETING PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE ON INTERNATIONAL LAWS. YOU MUST CONSULT
WITH QUALIFIED LEGAL COUNSEL IN RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.
6.7 Data Storage, Retention, and Security
Nous Meeting provides secure storage infrastructure for recordings, but you, as the host,
retain ultimate control and responsibility for:
a. Determining appropriate retention periods for recordings based on your legal
obligations and business needs
b. Implementing and enforcing access controls to recordings
c. Managing sharing and distribution of recordings in compliance with applicable
laws
d. Responding to participant requests for access, correction, or deletion of
recordings
e. Deleting recordings when legally required or when retention is no longer
necessary
f. Ensuring recordings are not shared with unauthorized parties
While Nous Meeting implements technical security measures (encryption at rest and in
transit, access controls, etc.), you are responsible for all policy decisions regarding recordings
and for ensuring your use complies with applicable data protection laws.
6.8 AI Processing of Recordings - Host's Responsibility
Nous Meeting uses artificial intelligence to process recordings for transcription,
summarization, action item extraction, and sentiment analysis. As the host, you are solely
responsible for:
a. Obtaining all necessary consents for AI processing of meeting content
b. Informing participants that recordings will be processed using AI technology

8

c. Ensuring AI processing complies with applicable data protection laws
d. Determining whether AI processing is permissible under your industry-specific
regulations (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA, GLBA)

expectation of privacy
c. Engage in illegal surveillance, wiretapping, stalking, harassment, or intimidation

e. Violate intellectual property rights, trade secrets, attorney-client privilege, or

g. Create deepfakes, manipulated content, or misleading representations from
recordings

Nous Meeting reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of this Privacy Policy and
applicable laws. If we become aware of potential illegal recording activity, we may: suspend
or terminate your account, disable recording features, delete recordings, report violations to
law enforcement, and cooperate with law enforcement investigations. However, such
enforcement actions do not diminish or eliminate your sole responsibility for legal
compliance.
